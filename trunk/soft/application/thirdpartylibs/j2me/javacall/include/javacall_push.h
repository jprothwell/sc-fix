 * permission to launch PUSH Java MIDlet. The function will be called by the Java task
 * whenever a MIDlet is not running, and a PUSH event was received. \n
 * It should display a native dialog box and should block until the user makes a
 * ACCEPT/REJECT selection. This selection is passed back as the return value of the
 * function. \n
 * Note that if the user approved running the MIDlet, the display focus will be held by
 * the Java VM until the MIDlet quits. If the user selected 'reject', the display will
 * return to the previous application.
