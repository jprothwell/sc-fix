        This file contains the portion of the module's memory map that will be
        accessible through CoolWatcher (or any CoolXml tool). It is also used
        for the get version mechanism.

            This struct will contain pointers to the calibration info and to the struct where
            to put the calibration context requests. It also contains the address of the
            calibration sector in flash.
