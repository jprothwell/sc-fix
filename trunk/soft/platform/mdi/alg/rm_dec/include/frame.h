/* beyond the end of a line of pixels.  The frame is laid out as shown below. */

/*          |    |     Y     |    |     around the Y plane.  The dotted line */
/*          |    |           |    |     separating the planes is there just */
/*          |    +-----------+    |     to emphasize that the padding around */
/*          |                     |     each plane does not overlap the */
/*          | .  .  .  .  .  .  . |     padding around the other planes. */
/*          |          .          | */
/*          |  +----+  .  +----+  |     Note that all three planes have */

/* Note that the class is designed to allow reusing existing buffer space */
/* for a smaller image size.  For example, if the frame buffer was originally */
/* allocated to hold a CIF image, and is then adjusted to hold a QCIF image, */
/* then the QCIF Y, U and V planes will reside in or about the upper left */
/* quadrant of the CIF-size frame buffer.  Such reuse can result in much */
/* wasted space.  If this is undesireable, then the existing large buffer */
/* should be explicitly deallocated prior to allocating the smaller size. */
/* */

/* To be fully general, this class should allow the amount of padding to be */
/* specified via a constructor parameter.  However, we don't need such */
/* generality currently.  To simplify the class, we will use the hard coded */
/* padding amounts defined below. */
