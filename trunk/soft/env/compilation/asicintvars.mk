## This will define the default target for which you will compile,

## This is useful to compile your code as a Ramrun.

## We can force to use a Romuator here (normally this is defined by the target).

## This defines the release mode in which you compile.

## Defines the type of MMI to compile for.

## Define VERBOSE to get more information during the make process.
